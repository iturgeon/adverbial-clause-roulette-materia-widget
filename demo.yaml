                Identify the function and pattern of the “because” clause:

                The new investor is usually disoriented and confused by market turbulence and the economic crises that often cause it; this is because he or she does not realize that there's nothing really new under the investment sun.

                IV – will get

                True, “lost” looks like it could be a past participle, but you can modify it with “very,” which suggests that it is an adjective. And if this sentence is passive, what is the active version? SOMETHING will lose you? What is the SOMETHING?

                A more plausible interpretation is that get = become and that this sentence is pattern IV.
